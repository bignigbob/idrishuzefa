          <br>
          <p align="center"> A six year old Vitalik Buterin was always keen about mathematics and programming. The fact that his mental math abilities far surpassed that of his peers
              was no small feat. His teachers sensed his superior brainpower and he was soon upgraded to the "Gifted Children Program" at his primary school in Canada.
              He excelled in academics and at 17 years of age, Vitalik could see his father, a computer programmer, following something called "Bitcoin". "A tech fad, only to pass soon", he thought.
              However, the more he read about Bitcoin, the more it fascinated him. In 2011, he co-founded the Bitcoin Magazine at 19 and chose to get paid in Bitcoin for his content. At the time,
              Bitcoin stood at $3 and Vitalik was earning a measely 5 BTC ($15) for each article.

              <br> <br>

              Fast forward to 2022, this bright teenager has managed to create his own cryptocurrency, Etehreum.
              <br>
              Ethereum is the second most popular coin in the world and boasts a total market cap of $185
              Billion at the time of writing.

              <br><br>

              Oh, and his measely 5 BTC salary per article?
              <br>
              <i><b> That is worth over  $100,000 in today's prices. $100,000 for a single article. Whew. </i> </b>

                <br> <br>

              Ethereum has managed to keep the number 2 spot since soon after its release in 2014. However, tokens like Solana and Avalanche have investors worried
              for one too many reasons. Just like Facebook and Google wiped out the audience of Myspace and Yahoo respectively despite being late to the party, the crypto world may
              have to prepare for the fallout of Ethereum…unless Ethereum developers have a masterplan up their sleeve.

                  <h3> What Is Ethereum? </h3>
                  <p > Ether, abbreviated ETH, is the native token used on the Ethereum Blockchain. The blockchain is responsible for the execution of deals or contracts
                    on the blockchain without the involvement of a middleman and in a secure, decentralized manner. These contracts are thus known as ‘Smart Contracts’
                     due to the elimination of a third party to validate a transaction. Furthermore, each transaction is permanently stored in the ledger with a fixed,
                     verifiable identity and history, allowing for transparency and immutability.

                     <br><br>

                    Each transaction on the blockchain charges a fee from the user requesting it and this fee is known as gas fees. Ethereum relies on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) technology
                    and an upgrade to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is within an arm’s reach but more on that later.

                     <br>

                      ETH was worth $0.70 during its release in 2014 and saw its peak of $4800 in November 2021 with the rest of the cryptocurrency market.
                      The last two years saw a boom in the NFT culture, and this has further increased the adoption of the ETH token since popular collections
                      like Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, etc. list their items on <a href=” https://opensea.io/explore-collections?tab=top” target=”_blank”><i>
                      OpenSea</i> </a> in exchange for ETH.

                      <p>
                      This was some background about the cryptocurrency boasting the second spot in the world of crypto. Now that the offerings of Ethereum and the
                      challenges it needs to overcome are clear, lets look at how our other competitors fare against this mammoth and how Ethereum developers are trying to
                      fight back.</p>

                      <h3> Enter SOL And AVAX </h3>
                      <p> Launched a couple months apart, Solana and Avalanche boast their own blockchain and native tokens, SOL and AVAX. Both projects claim to support high
                          speed transactions, low fees and scalable solutions for their apps and smart contracts. The two deliver quite well and despite their recent entry in the market,
                          Solana and Avalanche enjoy the 9th and 14th position respectively. A major difference between the two is that Solana does not have a limit on the maximum number
                          of SOL tokens that can exist, whereas Avalanche will only ever have a maximum of 720 million AVAX tokens in circulation.

                        <br> <br>

                        Termed as the “Ethereum Killers”, these two projects are serious contenders for that second spot.

                <h3> Some Background... </h3>
                <h4> Proof-Of-Work (PoW) </h4>
                <p> PoW relies on advanced computational power to solve mathematical problems. The computer that solves this problem is rewarded with the underlying asset,
                  such as Bitcoin, which uses the PoW algorithm among many other cryptocurrencies. One major downside of this algorithm is its energy consumption and is a rising
                  concern among governments of leading world powers.
                </p>

                  <br>

                  <h4> Proof-Of-Stake (PoS) </h4>
                  <p> PoS relies on holders "staking" or locking up their assets, so that they cannot trade or sell them, and get rewarded for doing this. PoS is far more energy
                      efficient and relies on "Validators" and "Nodes" to complete the blockchain and maintain integrity of each transaction. It is much more energy efficient and
                      distributed as compared to PoW.

                <br>
                <h3> Ethereum Fights Back</h3>
                <p> First proposed in 2017, the major stakeholders and the founding body - the Ethereum Organization - decided to change Ethereum from a Blockchain based on Proof-Of-Work (PoW) to
                    Proof-Of-Stake (PoS) for the many benefits offered by the latter. Proof-Of-Stake was first launched in 2012 and was not the algorithm of choice when Ethereum was created in 2014 because it was still
                    a recent development with little evidence to prove it could live up to its claims.

                    <br><br><br>

                    The transition to PoS is being called "The Merge" or "Ethereum 2.0". After 5 years of delays and planning, it is scheduled for September 15 and offers several benefits: </p>
                    <h4> 1) Reduced Energy consumption </h4>
                    <p> The shift to PoS aims to reduce the energy consumption of Ethereum by 99%. This is a huge deal and can fuel adoption among governments and organizations.
                  </p>
                    <h4> 2) Deflationary </h4>
                    <p> The Merge aims to make Ethereum Deflationary by reducing the supply of tokens every year. This should lead to better valuation in the long term.
                    </p>
                    <h4> 4) Improved transaction Speed </h4>
                    <p> Each block will be minted or created a little quickly and this will provide a slight improvement in transaction speed.
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p> However, what The Merge does not change is the transaction costs for the coin. High transaction fees have been an important consideration for investors to seek alternatives
                      and the transaction does not seem to offer any solution to reduce this fees in the foreseeable future. This is a huge downside as this makes small transactions on the blockchain
                      counter intuitive and investors seek cheaper options such as SOL and AVAX.
                    </p>

              <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
              <p>I strongly believe this transition will fuel adoption in governments and institutions and promote novel use of Ethereum in the future. Innovative individuals will manage to
              find ways to further the proposed agenda for the cryptocurrency. Currently trading at $1,730, I personally expect Ethereum to hit a price target upwards of $10,000 by 2024 and surpass
            $15,000 in 2025 as crypto adoption finds its way around the globe. </p>

                 <p>Conclusively, here are few personal favorites from the world of Ethereum:
